# PreprocessingPipeline-ContRegClassifier-SWANSF
Accurate solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating risks to astronauts, space equipment, and satellite communication. Our study enhances prediction accuracy using advanced preprocessing and a novel deep learning-based classifier called ContReg on the SWAN-SF dataset, outperforming previous methods.
